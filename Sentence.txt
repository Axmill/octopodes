Quickly,
a spoon is struck
without a word,
a chicken clucks;

With a buck,
the deer tucks a blanket into a tree;

Slowly,
a triangle flies to the south:
it finds the city it was looking for
and sees twelve plus twelve rats;

Luckily,
rats can sigh,
rats can add,
rats can be,
rats can 2;

Now,
instruct you forward,
stop tomorrow,
don't buy a
chicken.
